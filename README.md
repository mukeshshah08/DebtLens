# DebtLens
This project leverages World Bankâ€™s International Debt Statistics dataset to analyze debt patterns across nations from 1970 to the present. Using data science techniques, we perform exploratory analysis, statistical insights, clustering, and predictive modeling to understand global debt dynamics and provide actionable insights for policymakers.
